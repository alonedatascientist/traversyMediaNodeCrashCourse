What is Node JS? A Java Script run time used to run Java Script outside of a browser as a server side language. Node is also used frequently for APIs and various run time services.

Why choose Node? Node is fast, effective, event driven (runs on a single loop) w/ a non blocking I/O model, its very popular in the industry and if you are already learning JS it allows you to use the same language on the front and backend(s). 

Non-Blocking I/O explained: Node/JS works on a non-blocking single thread. It supports tens of thousands of concurrent connections and optimizes throughput/scalablity/I/O operations -- making it very fast.

Best types of node projects - really anything not CPU intensive. Its great for REST API / Microservices, real time services (chat, live updates, etc), CRUD apps (blogs, shopping, social networks), tools and utilities.

Node Modules - provide various functionality for us. Some are core built in modules, others are 3rd party (installed via NPM), or your own custom modules (files) can be imported and used.

In node/js we have a class called EventEmitter these instances emmit particular 'events' that can then be listened for by other functions ('listeners') that then take a particular action (a function usually) after the event has been emiited and heard by the listener
